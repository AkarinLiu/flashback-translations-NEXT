# Unofficial Flashback Translations

[![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/flashback-fabric/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/flashback-fabric)

Unofficial translations for the mod [Flashback](https://modrinth.com/mod/flashback).

This mod is a very new mod. Many of the messages in the mod have not been provided as translatable text by the author.

## Translating
By submitting translations, you are agreeing to have them licensed under the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license.

You can contribute to the translation effort on our Crowdin project page! First you'll need to register a Crowdin account if you haven't already. Translators are able to translate (submit a translation for an untranslated phrase), suggest (propose a better translation compared to an existing one), or vote (vote up or down the quality of a translation).

Please note that new versions will be created every Saturday if there are changes. If you don't see the most recent translations, please check back later for a new release.

For more information on using Crowdin, please see their "Intro For Volunteer Translators" support page.
